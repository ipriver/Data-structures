# Data-structures
Here you can find my implemetations of different data-structures (linked-list, queue, stack, etc.) with Python3, Javascript and Go languages.<br />
Feel free using this code-classes or Test-cases in your practice.<br />
JavaScript is using Mocha+Chai for tests, so install it with command below:
```console
npm i
```
and run all tests with command:
```console
npm test
```
Python3 is using unittest framework, just run file RunAllTests.py to run tests:
```console
python3 RunAllTests.py
```
Golang is using package "testing", use command below to run _test.go file tests:
```console
go test testfile.go testfile_test.go
```
